</p>

The  [realtek-zephyr-project](https://github.com/rtkconnectivity/realtek-zephyr-project) repository is the entry point for Zephyr development on Realtek Bee Series SoCs. Realtek Zephyr SDK is built on top of the Zephyr Project, reusing the same tools, workflows, and dependencies. 

## What is Zephyr?

The Zephyr Project is a Linux Foundation hosted Collaboration Project. Itâ€™s an open source collaborative effort uniting developers and users in building a best-in-class small, scalable, real-time operating system (RTOS) optimized for resource-constrained devices, across multiple architectures.

## What is Realtek Zephyr SDK?

Realtek Zephyr SDK is the Realtek's Zephyr downstream solution, which mainly contains three Github repositories:

- [realtek-zephyr-project](https://github.com/rtkconnectivity/realtek-zephyr-project): Default manifest repo containing Realtek's applications developed based on Zephyr.

- [zephyr](https://github.com/rtkconnectivity/zephyr): Realtek downstream Zephyr containing Realtek Bee Series SoCs support. It is developed on top of tagged release from the Zephyr Upstream (currently is Zephyr v3.7 LTS).

- [hal_realtek](https://github.com/rtkconnectivity/hal_realtek): Hardware Abstraction Layer for Realtek Bee Series SoCs containing driver sources and platform files.
